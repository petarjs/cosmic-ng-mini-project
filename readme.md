# Cosmic Angular Mini Test

## Accomplishments

To start working, first clone the repo  
`git clone git@github.com:petarslovic/cosmic-ng-mini-project.git'  

Then inside the project root, install dependencies with  
`npm install` (or `sudo npm install` if you are on linux/osx)  
`bower install`  

Now you're ready to run the project, type  
`gulp serve`  
and you're ready to go.
